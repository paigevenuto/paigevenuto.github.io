            <h2>Setting up the IDE</h2>

            <p>The first thing I did after purchasing my Digispark was to install the
            <strong>Arduino IDE</strong>.  On linux you can install the <code>arduino</code> package from your
            usual package manager, although if the provided package isn’t up to date you
            can download the latest package from here instead:
            <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">arduino.cc/en/Main/Software</a></p>

            <p>Next is to make sure that the <code>libusb</code> driver package is installed. It is also
            recommended to install the development package too, since it includes
            <code>libusb-config</code> which is needed later.</p>

            <p>Once the drivers were installed I had to make sure that the udev rules were
            set, since linux tends to need udev rules in order to keep usb devices
            read-only. There were already rules available from Digistump’s website, and so
            I simply placed those in <strong>/etc/udev/rules.d/49-micronucleus.rules</strong></p>

            <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code> sudo echo '
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16d0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0753", MODE:="0666"
KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16d0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0753", MODE:="0666", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
' &gt; /etc/udev/rules.d/49-micronucleus.rules </code></pre>

            <p>Here is the section of the website for more details: <a href="http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/linuxtroubleshooting#ubuntu_troubleshooting">Digistump Wiki, Linux
                Troubleshooting</a></p>

            <p>To be on the safe side I then reload the rules</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>sudo udevadm control --reload-rules</code></pre>

            <p>The next steps are to open the Arduino IDE and install the digispark board.
            First I add the URL for the board manager I need by going to
            <strong>File>Preferences</strong> and then pasting the following link into <strong>Additional
                Boards Managers URLs</strong>.</p>

            <p><code>http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json</code></p>

            <p>Then I install the board manager by going to Tools>Board>Board Manager and
            searching for Digistump AVR Boards. Then enable Digispark (Default - 16.5 MHz)
            under Tools>Board.</p>

            <p>The guide from Digistump says that it isn’t necessary to change the programmer
            that you are using, but to be on the safe side I went to <strong>Tools>Programmer</strong> and
            selected the <strong>Micronucleus</strong> programmer which becomes available after intsalling
            the Digistump AVR Boards.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately though, the version of the Micronucleus driver that you get from
            Digistump is actually outdated in their provided .json for the board manager.
            The solution here is to compile a new driver from Micronucleus’s github
            repository. Then to replace the board manager&rsquo;s micronucleus file with the new
            one. You can delete the micronucleus folder later if you wish.</p>

            <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code> git clone https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus.git
cd micronucleus
cd commandline
make
chmod +x micronucleus
mv ~/.arduino15/packages/digistump/tools/micronucleus/2.0a4/micronucleus micronucleus.old
cp micronucleus ~/.arduino15/packages/digistump/tools/micronucleus/2.0a4/
rm -rf ~/micronucleus </code></pre>

            <p>Lastly I restarted Arduino just to be safe, since I had just modified one of
            the files it was using.</p>

            <h2>Testing the Digispark</h2>

            <p>At this point I was able to compile to my Digispark, so to test it I went to
            <strong>File>Examples</strong> and loaded some sample code called DigisparkKeyboard, compiled
            it, plugged in my device when prompted, and it compiled smoothly.</p>

            <p><img src="../images/usbduck/arduino.png" alt="Successful compile" /></p>

            <p>To make sure everything I had done was successful I then closed Arduino, opened
            up vim, and plugged in my Digispark for it to type the default &ldquo;Hello Digispark!&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>Making a payload</h2>

            <p>To make the payload the options are endless, although due to the
            size limit on the Digispark it isn't possible to fit entire
            payloads on the device itself, so this is where you would want to
            host the payload elsewhere and have the Digispark download it with
            a command.</p>

            <p>For PowerShell payloads you can use the WebClient.DownloadString
            method to download a .ps1 file for executing on the machine.
            However other options include using curl, wget, or git, depending
            on the situation and operating system.</p>

            <p>Many of the common pranks and attacks for this tool have already
            been turned into Digispark payloads by CedArctic, and can be used
            for inspiration for delivering new payloads.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/CedArctic/DigiSpark-Scripts">GitHub Digispark Ducky Scripts by CedArctic</a></p>

            <h2>Defending against rubber duckies</h2>

            <p>One of the drawbacks to rubber duckies is that the method of
            delivering payloads requires keypresses which lead to the command
            prompt, terminal, or powershell using common shortcuts. If these
            programs are unavailable, the script is unable to run, and so by
            protecting these programs with a password prompt prevents the
            device from being able to execute malicious code.</p>

            <p>Another drawback is that the rubber duck relies on having
            physical access to the device. By requiring devices and their ports
            to be in locations that are inaccessible, an attacker is unable to
            plug a rubber duck into vulnerable devices without unnoticed.</p>
