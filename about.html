                <h2>Hello world,</h2>
                <p>I am Paige Venuto, a script kiddie leveling up to become a full-fledged professional. When I'm not studying, I prefer to relax with a cup of tea and a good book.</p>
                <p>The first time I discovered my passion for technology was during high school, when I was working with a team of other students to build a solar car that we would use to compete in a race at Daytona Speedway. I also first was introduced to coding through programming robots, which I would use to compete against my fellow classmates in small skirmishes, and eventually we made it all the way to state finals in the First Tech Challenge robotics competition.</p>
                <p>Everything I have learned since then has been through self study, although I have very recently started learning from a software engineering bootcamp that will allow me to pivot into the software industry from my background in IT.</p>
                <p>I like to live an extremely minimalist life, even down to the little things. I choose not to have social media accounts, and everything I own can fit within a single crate which makes moving a breeze. Any books I own are in digital format, and the exceptions as scan into pdfs. I take this approach to my technology as well, because simplicity and efficiency are beautiful. With this I can spend more time focusing on the things that I care about rather than being distracted with the ads, branding, consumerism, and meme warfare that is our modern age.</p>
